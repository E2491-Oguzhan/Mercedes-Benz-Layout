            Mercedes-Benz and the upcoming “Avatar” films – what at first seemed
            to be an unexpected global partnership, turned into a unique
            interdisciplinary experience. Inspired by the world of “Avatar”, the
            two partners created the astonishing VISION AVTR. In this exclusive
            behind-the-scenes feature, key team members from both parties share
            their thoughts on the cooperation process and provide fascinating
            insights into the concept vehicle itself.

            The aesthetic of modern luxury is characterised by timeless beauty,
            a combination of high-grade technology and craftsmanship as well as
            a reduction to what is really important.

            The designers at Mercedes-Benz are reconciling tradition and
            modernity in designing the cars for the future. Their work centres
            on “Sensual Purity” as an expression of modern luxury. The new
            design idiom featuring reduced edges and creases – indentations and
            recesses in the sheet metal – aims to create clear forms and sensual
            surfaces which showcase high tech while also arousing emotions.
            Design creates something out of the ordinary and makes a major
            contribution to shaping the brand image. For Mercedes-Benz
            designers, good design has to be both beautiful and intelligent.

            The new A-Class Saloon’s minimalist design with an independent rear
            end with striking two-part tail lights, the revolutionary MBUX
            (Mercedes-Benz User Experience) is another highlight. It may not
            take the wheel, but it does make driving as comfortable as possible.
            Thanks to artificial intelligence, the system is capable of learning
            and, over time, gets better acquainted with the driver. With the
            intelligent LINGUATRONIC voice control system, you can talk almost
            as naturally as you would with a good friend.Even at first glance,
            the new Mercedes-Benz A-Class draws the eye with its
            athletic-emotional design. YouTube pro MrJWW demonstrates how the
            car’s side catwalk line, broad shoulders and extended wheelbase
            shape the sleek design. His favourite detail? The iconic star
            grille. What’s yours?The purist, surface-accentuating design of the
            new A-Class is the next step in the Mercedes-Benz design philosophy
            of Sensual Purity. On the basis of a compact two-box design,
            optimised dimensions and proportions have led to a new
            interpretation of the A-Class’s design. <br /><br />
